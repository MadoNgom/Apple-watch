There are several React hooks that are important for a front-end developer to know when working with React. Here are a few of the most important ones:

useState: This hook allows a component to manage its own state internally. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update the state.

useEffect: This hook allows a component to run side-effects after rendering, such as fetching data or interacting with the DOM. It takes a function as an argument, which will be called after the component renders. It also takes an array of dependencies as a second argument, which will determine when the effect should be re-run.

useContext: This hook allows a component to access context, which is a way to share data across multiple components without passing props down the component tree.

useRef: it's a way to target DOM node or element directly in functional components,

useCallback: This hook is similar to useEffect, but it allows you to optimize the performance of your component by returning a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

useMemo: This Hook allows you to memoize values, it's similar to useCallback, but it returns a m emoized value instead of a callback.

When to use:

useState: It should be used whenever a component needs to manage its own internal state.

useEffect: It should be used whenever a component needs to run side effects, such as fetching data or interacting with the DOM, after it has rendered.

useContext: It is used whenever a component needs to access data that is not passed down as props.

useRef: It should be used whenever a component needs to target a DOM element node or a JavaScript object directly in functional components

useCallback: It should be used to optimize the performance of your component by returning a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

useMemo: It should be used to memoize values for performance optimization.

It's important to keep in mind that hooks should only be called at the top level of your component, and not inside loops or conditions.
// context api allow us to prop drilling where child compoent are passed down to the parent component that looking for specfique function or state;
// fistr of all we need to create a context and after
const personContext = React.createContext();
// the moment that we create a context we have now access to two component provider and the consumer
const ContextApi = () => {
return <h1>hello there</h1>;
};
